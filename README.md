Scripts that download videos from a list of Youtube links, edit them in a format of "Top 10" and export to mp4 format.

Youtube channel with some videos made with the scripts: [Great Games To Play](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQVOk3d9C2rnLBt-b-J9cQ)

**youtube-dl pakage is required to download the videos**

# How to use

it's not fully automated, so there is a need to do some manual work to make the videos look good(like the ones on the above Youtube channel).

- Put the youtube video links on the "list.txt" file
- Above each link, put the Title of the video you want to show one the bottom left coner
- The download path is hardcoded, so you need to change that in the "ytvideodownload.py" file
- Run "ytvideodownload.py" to download the videos
- Edit the downloaded videos to your liking(don't change their names)
- Change the "videomake.py" varibles to the path you want
- Done
